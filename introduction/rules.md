3. An automatic dispute resolution process means a process associated with a digital asset that is intended to resolve a dispute between interested parties by the automatic selection of a person or panel or artificial intelligence agent whose vote or decision is implemented directly within the digital asset system (including by operating, modifying, canceling, creating or transferring digital assets);

## 3. Incorporation
These rules may be incorporated into a contract, digital asset or digital asset system by including the text (which may be in electronic or encoded form) “Any dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Curia Dispute Resolution Rules” and, optionally, by specifying:
1. Whether any particular issue or type of dispute (an expert issue) should be resolved by expert determination instead of arbitration;
2. Any preferences as to the number, identity or qualifications of any persons to be appointed as arbitrators or experts;
3. Any preferences as to the procedure to be adopted for the resolution of a dispute, including as to form and timing of any decision or arbitral award (as applicable), recoverable costs and anonymity;
4. Any modifications to the application or operation of the rules.

## 4. Automatic dispute resolution.
An automatic dispute resolution decision shall be legally binding on interested parties. 

## 5. Submission to arbitration. 
Any dispute between interested parties arising out of the relevant contract or digital asset which was not the subject of a dispute resolution process otherwise specified by the contract or digital asset shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the version of these rules which is current at the time of submission; but any expert issue shall be determined by an appointed expert acting as such and not as an arbitrator.

## 6. Commencement of proceedings. 
An interested party (a claimant) may commence proceedings by giving a notice of claim to each other interested party against whom a claim is made (a respondent) and to the appointment body. The notice shall include the following information: 
1. The claimant's identity details;
2. Electronic contact details for the claimant and each respondent; 
3. Brief details of the claim, including a statement of the remedy sought; 
4. Details of any preferences specified in accordance with rule 3 above;
5. Proposals for paying or securing the fees of the appointment body and the tribunal; 

And may also include any other material relevant to the claim, including supporting documents, supporting digital material, witness statements and arguments, and any proposals as to the procedure to be adopted.

## 7. Initial response.
Within three (3) days of receipt of a notice of claim, each respondent shall send an initial response to the claimant, each other respondent and the appointment body. The initial response shall include the respondent’s identity details and electronic contact details and may also (but need not) include comments on the claim, the respondent’s proposals for the procedure, the respondent’s proposals for paying or securing the fees of the appointment body and the tribunal, and any other material relevant to the claim.

## 8. Appointment of tribunal. 
The appointment body shall appoint a tribunal as soon as practicable after the time for receipt of the initial responses and shall notify the parties of the identity of the arbitrators or experts and their electronic contact details. The appointment body shall have regard to any preferences specified or agreed as to the number, identity or qualifications of arbitrators or experts but shall not be bound by them. The appointment body and the tribunal shall not be obliged to act, or to continue acting, unless reasonable arrangements have been made to pay or secure their fees. The appointment body may publish anonymised statistics from time to time as to appointments made, and the general nature of disputes commenced.

## 9. Procedure.
The tribunal shall have absolute discretion as to what procedure is adopted thereafter, but in exercising its discretion shall act fairly and impartially as between the parties, giving each party a reasonable opportunity of putting their case and responding to that of their opponent. Having regard to available technologies and the need for expedition, the tribunal shall adopt procedures suitable to the circumstances of the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delay or expense, so as to provide a fair means for the resolution of the matters falling to be determined. The parties may propose (jointly by agreement, or severally) their preferred procedural method of conducting the matter and timeline and such proposal shall not be binding upon the tribunal.  When a difference arises among the tribunal concerning the procedure to be adopted, it shall be decided by a majority vote. If that is not possible, either an arbitrator or a party may refer the question to the appointment body. 

## 10. Evidence and submissions.
Having consulted the parties, the tribunal shall have absolute discretion as to what evidence and argument it considers and in what form. The tribunal shall permit parties to submit evidence and argument electronically. The tribunal may determine the dispute on the basis of written submissions only.

## 11. Power in relation to digital assets. 
The tribunal shall have the power to  order parties to relinquish control over digital assets relevant to the dispute to the tribunal or impartial third party, including a multisignature wallet or appropriate escrow contract. The tribunal shall have the power at any time to order and/or undertake the operation, modification, signing or cancelation of any digital asset relevant to the dispute using any digital signature, cryptographic key, password or other digital access or control mechanism available to it. The tribunal shall also have the power to direct any interested party or involved third party to do any of those things.

## 12. Time for and form of awards and decisions. 
The tribunal shall use its best endeavors to determine the dispute within any time period specified or agreed by the parties or, if none is specified or agreed, within thirty (30) days from its appointment. Any award or decision of the tribunal must be in writing (which includes in electronic form) and must be signed by the tribunal (which may be by digital signature or cryptographic key).

## 13. Optional anonymity. 
The claimant and each respondent must provide details and evidence of their identity to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. If the incorporating text allows for anonymous dispute resolution, or the parties agree, a claimant or respondent may provide the required identity details confidentially to the tribunal alone and need not include them in a notice of claim or initial response. In that case the tribunal shall not disclose the identity details unless disclosure is necessary for the fair resolution of the dispute, for the enforcement of any decision or award, for the protection of the tribunal’s own interests, or if required by any law or regulation or court order.

## 14. Consolidation. 
Tribunals appointed in different arbitrations under these rules may, if each tribunal concurs, order that the arbitrations be consolidated and that a consolidated tribunal (composed of some or all of the members of the different tribunals) be appointed to hear them.

## 15. Publication of anonymised awards and decisions. 
If the tribunal considers that an award or decision is of general interest, and if the parties do not object, the tribunal may provide it in anonymised form to the appointment body for publication. In the event that a decision involving one or more anonymous parties is to be published by the tribunal, the tribunal shall use nicknames in order to secure the anonymity of the said party.

## 16. Jurisdiction.
The juridical seat of any arbitration shall be determined by the parties. The parties shall be free to agree upon the rules of law to be applied by the arbitral tribunal to the merits of the dispute. In the absence of any such agreement, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules of law which it determines to be appropriate. The decision or award of the tribunal is final and binding. There is no right to appeal any award on a point of law, and there is no other right of appeal or challenge to such award except as permitted under the applicable law.

## 17. Disclosure.
Any person appointed or to be appointed as an arbitrator, as well as the parties and their representatives, shall disclose to the appointing body any circumstance likely to give rise to justifiable doubt as to an arbitrator’s impartiality or independence, including any bias or any financial or personal interest in the result of the arbitration or any past or present relationship with the parties or their representatives. Such obligation shall remain in effect throughout the arbitration. Failure on the part of a party or a representative to comply with the requirements of this rule may result in the waiver of the right to object to an arbitrator

Upon receipt of such information from the arbitrator or another source, the appointing body shall communicate the information to the parties and, if it deems it appropriate to do so, to the arbitrator and others. Disclosure of information is not an indication that the arbitrator considers that the disclosed circumstance is likely to affect impartiality or independence.
