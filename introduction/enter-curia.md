# What is Curia?



Curia is an on-chain alternative to traditional arbitration, not to be mistaken with tokenized juror arbitration protocols that rely on game theory mechanisms.&#x20;

There are two main issues with traditional arbitration that makes it inefficient for crypto-related disputes: 1) It's very expensive and 2) it's not enforceable on-chain. Curia offers affordable, professional arbitration and ensures that disputes can be enforced on-chain, using our own smart escrow (LexLocker).

In contrast with other on-chain arbitration protocols, Curia _is_ curated. We offer specialized panels of arbitrators, formed by Lawyers and Legal Engineers from LexDAO.&#x20;

Even though on-chain arbitration is the main product offered by Curia, we also offer traditional arbitration (although not enforceable on-chain), mediation, and escrow services.
