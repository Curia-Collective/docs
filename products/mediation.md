# Mediation

Even though arbitration is our main product, we encourage parties to seek mediation before proceeding to an arbitration (this is optional). Our aim with Curia is to solve disputes between parties, but also reduce friction between them, because as the Roman historian Tacitus said, "a bad peace is worse than war".&#x20;

Therefore, the best way to ensure that both parties are on good terms is to provide an alternative in which they can both agree upon the outcome of the dispute resolution, and that's mediation.&#x20;

The process would be simple:

1. Parties agree to submit their dispute to Curia Mediation, and if the nature of the dispute is related to tokens (ERC721 or ERC20) then they can lock them in our escrow (LexLocker).
2. Mediators are assigned by our appointment tribunal and they proceed to create three chat rooms. 1 shared among all and 2 separate rooms (or more, depending on the number of parties involved).
3. Optional, an intro call, and an outro call if they all agree.
4. Curia Mediators would spend a maximum of three days going back and forth with the parties, presenting an agreement based on what was discussed. Parties have one day to decide if they agree upon this or not.
5. If the parties agree upon the proposed agreement then it's signed by them plus the Curia Mediators and published as an NFT (if parties want it to remain private then it could be minted as an NFT with unlockable content only visible by the parties). If funds were locked in the escrow, then they will be released accordingly.&#x20;
6. If a consensus can't be reached then we would proceed with an arbitration.
